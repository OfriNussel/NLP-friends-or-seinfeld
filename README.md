Text Classification for TV Show Scripts
- This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify scripts from the popular TV shows "Friends" and "Seinfeld." By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to analyze and distinguish the textual data of these shows, ultimately creating a model that can predict whether a new text belongs to "Friends" or "Seinfeld."
